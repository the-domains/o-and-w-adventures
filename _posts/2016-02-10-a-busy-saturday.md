# A busy Saturday 

Last Saturday we had a pretty busy day.  It started with some volunteering at a school in LA.  Daddy and I painted the sun on a mural and then helped dig a ditch. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7512ed88-8ddd-4933-8afe-a8013d3a2f45.JPG)

After that we went to Dave and Busters.  We played lots of games. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a4f12bdb-c158-450e-874d-7dcc9d575628.JPG)

We ended the day with Chopped at our house.  We made desserts from mystery ingredients. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f98f5921-bbaa-4896-a3ec-118612bfb8ac.JPG)
